This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and
high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as
suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials through use of bitstrings.
      </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
It is often useful for an <a>issuer</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a>
[[VC-DATA-MODEL]] to link to a location where a <a>verifier</a> can check to see
if a credential has been suspended or revoked. There are a variety of privacy
and performance considerations that are made when designing, publishing, and
processing status lists.
      </p>
      <p>
One such privacy consideration happens when there is a one-to-one mapping
between a <a>verifiable credential</a> and a URL where the status is
published. This type of mapping enables the website that publishes the URL to
correlate the <a>holder</a>, time, and <a>verifier</a> when the status is
checked. This could enable the <a>issuer</a> to discover the type of interaction
the <a>holder</a> is having with the <a>verifier</a>, such as providing an age
verification credential when entering a bar. Being tracked by the <a>issuer</a>
of a driver's license when entering an establishment violates a privacy
expectation that many people have today.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, there are performance considerations that are explored when designing
status lists. One such consideration is where the list is published and the
burden it places from a bandwidth and processing perspective, both on the server
and the client fetching the information. In order to meet privacy expectations,
it is useful to bundle the status of large sets of credentials into a single
list to help with herd privacy. However, doing so can place an impossible
burden on both the server and client if the status information is as much as a
few hundred bytes in size per credential across a population of
hundreds of millions of <a>holders</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The rest of this document proposes a highly compressible, bitstring-based
status list mechanism with strong privacy-preserving characteristics,
that is compatible with the architecture of the Web, is highly space-efficient,
and lends itself well to content distribution networks. As an example of
using this specification to achieve a number of beneficial privacy and
performance goals, it is possible to create a status list that can be
constructed for 100,000 <a>verifiable credentials</a> that is roughly
12,500 bytes in size in the worst case. In a case where a few hundred
credentials have been revoked, the size of the list is less than a
few hundred bytes while providing privacy in a herd of 100,000 individuals.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>

        <p>
  This section outlines the core concept utilized by the status list
  mechanism described in this document. At the most basic level, status
  information for all <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a>
  are expressed as simple binary values. The <a>issuer</a> keeps a bitstring
  list of all <a>verifiable credentials</a> it has issued. Each
  <a>verifiable credential</a> is associated with a position in the list. If
  the binary value of the position in the list is 1 (one), the
  <a>verifiable credential</a> is revoked, if it is 0 (zero) it is not revoked.
        </p>

        <p>
  One of the benefits of using a bitstring is that it is a highly compressible
  data format since, in the average case, large numbers of credentials will
  remain unrevoked. This will ensure long sections of bits that are the same
  value and thus highly compressible using run-length compression techniques
  such as GZIP [[RFC1952]]. The default bitstring size is 16KB (131,072 entries),
  and when only a handful of <a>verifiable credentials</a> are revoked, the
  compressed bitstring size is reduced down to a few hundred bytes.
        </p>

        <p>
  Another benefit of using a bitstring is that it enables large numbers of
  <a>verifiable credential</a> statuses to be placed in the same  list.
  This specification utilizes a minimum bitstring length of 131,072 (16KB). This
  population size ensures an adequate amount of herd  privacy in the average case.
  If better herd privacy is required, the bitstring can be made to be larger.
        </p>

               GZIP compressed into a cylinder on the bottom of the page shows
               that compression has resulted in a final size of 135 bytes.">

        <h3>BitstringStatusListEntry</h3>

        <p>
When an <a>issuer</a> desires to enable status information for a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, they MAY add a <code>credentialStatus</code>
property that uses the data model described in this specification.
        </p>

            <tr>
              <td>id</td>
              <td>
An optional identifier for the status list entry. The constraints on the
<code>id</code> property are listed in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
specification [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]. If present, the value is expected to be a URL
that identifies the status information associated with the <a>verifiable
credential</a>. It MUST NOT be the URL for the status list. The value is
not used during the verification or validation process, and does not need to be
related to the `statusListCredential` value. If necessary, the value can be
used to uniquely identify the `BitstringStatusListEntry` object, such as when it is
stored in a database.

(<code>0</code>), is located at the left-most bit in the bitstring and the
last index, with a value of one less than the length of the bitstring
(<code>bitstring_length - 1</code>), is located at the right-most bit in the
bitstring. Further information on bitstring encoding can be found in Section

    <h2>Media Types</h2>
    <p>
      When dereferencing <code>statusListCredential</code>,
      the content type of the <code>statusListCredential</code> might
      be any media type registered for the purpose of expressing a
      verifiable credential with one or more proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a verifiable credential secured with 
      Data Integrity Proofs might have content type <code>application/vc+ld+json</code>,
      whereas a verifiable credential secured with 
      SD-JWT might have content-type <code>application/sd-jwt</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some implementations might choose to support less specific media types such as
      <code>application/ld+json</code> or <code>application/json</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dereferencing over HTTP, 
      the use of the <a data-cite="rfc7231#section-5.3.2">accept</a> 
      and <a data-cite="rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5">content-type</a> headers,

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Revocation Bitstring Length</h3>

      <p>
This document specifies a minimum revocation bitstring length of 131,072, or
16KB uncompressed. This is enough to give <a>holders</a> an adequate amount of
herd privacy if the number of verifiable credentials issued is large enough.
However, if the number of issued verifiable credentials is a small population,
the ability to correlate an individual increases because the number of allocated
slots in the bitstring is small. Correlating this information with, for example,
where the geographic request came from can also help to correlate individuals
that have received a credential from the same geographic region.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Verifier Caching</h3>

      <p>
It is possible for <a>verifiers</a> to increase the privacy of the
<a>holder</a> whose <a>verifiable credential</a> is being checked by caching
status lists that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the
content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from
<a>verifier</a>-based access patterns on the status list.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>

      <p>
The use of content distribution networks by <a>issuers</a> can increase the
privacy of <a>holders</a> by reducing or eliminating requests for the
status lists from the <a>issuer</a>. Often, a request for a revocation
list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
on the server as well as cloaking <a>verifiers</a> and <a>holders</a>
from <a>issuers</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

<section class="informative">
<h3>Malicious Issuers and Verifiers</h3>
<p>
In general, the herd privacy protections offered by this specification can be circumvented by malicious <a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>. Its privacy benefits can only be realized when issuers and verifiers intend to avoid tracking or sharing the presentation of particular credentials.
</p>
<p>
A malicious <a>issuer</a> might intentionally attack herd privacy by creating a
unique status list per credential issued in order to establish a 1-1 mapping to track
when a <a>verifier</a> processes a specific credential. Similarly, they could establish
another a 1-1 mapping by using a different cryptographic key for every credential
issued that is tracked in a status list.
</p>
<p>
A malicious <a>verifier</a> might intentionally attack herd privacy by sharing
information from presented credentials with a malicious <a>issuer</a>.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Bitstring Encoding</h3>

      <p>
It is critical that implementers pay particular attention to the way that they
encode and decode bitstrings. Failure to do so can result in checking the
wrong bitstring index for a given credential, leading to a misinterpretation
of its present state (e.g., mistaking a revoked status for an unrevoked
status). As stated in Section <a href="#bitstringstatuslistcredential"></a>,
bitstrings are encoded such that the first (zeroth) index refers to the
left-most bit of the bitstring array. The diagram below demonstrates the
proper layout for an uncompressed bitstring.
      </p>

      <figure id="bitstring-layout">
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
             src="diagrams/bitstring-layout.svg" alt="a diagram showing two
             wide rectangles shown side-by-side. Each rectangle is partitioned
             into eight boxes to represent the 8 bits in a byte. The left
             rectangle is labeled 'First byte' and the right rectangle is
             labeled 'Last byte'. The left rectangle's left-most bit box is
             pointed to by an arrow labeled 'index: 0'. The right rectangle's
             right-most bit box is pointed to by an arrow labeled
             'index: length - 1'.">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
          A visual depiction of the bitstring layout.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
For example, if a bitstring is 131,072 bits in size (16KB), the first index will be 0, and the last index will be 131,071.
      </p>
      <p>
Implementations SHOULD consume and/or assign indexes randomly.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
