This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and

The Working Group is actively seeking implementation feedback for this
specification. In order to exit the Candidate Recommendation phase, the
Working Group has set the requirement of at least two independent
implementations for each mandatory or optional feature in the specification. For details
on the conformance testing process, see the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-bitstring-status-list-test-suite/">
implementation report</a>.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
It is often useful for an [=issuer=] of [=verifiable credentials=]
[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] to link to a location where a [=verifier=] can check to see
if a credential has been suspended or revoked. There are a variety of privacy
and performance considerations that are made when designing, publishing, and
processing status lists.
      </p>
      <p>
One such privacy consideration happens when there is a one-to-one mapping
between a [=verifiable credential=] and a URL where the status is
published. This type of mapping enables the website that publishes the URL to
correlate the [=holder=], time, and [=verifier=] when the status is
checked. This could enable the [=issuer=] to discover the type of interaction
the [=holder=] is having with the [=verifier=], such as providing an age
verification credential when entering a bar. Being tracked by the [=issuer=]
of a driver's license when entering an establishment violates a privacy
expectation that many people have today.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, there are performance considerations that are explored when designing
status lists. One such consideration is where the list is published and the
burden it places from a bandwidth and processing perspective, both on the server
and the client fetching the information. In order to meet privacy expectations,
it is useful to bundle the status of large sets of credentials into a single
list to help with group privacy. However, doing so can place an impossible
burden on both the server and client if the status information is as much as a
few hundred bytes in size per credential across a population of
hundreds of millions of [=holders=].
      </p>
      <p>
The rest of this document proposes a highly compressible, bitstring-based
status list mechanism with strong privacy-preserving characteristics,
that is compatible with the architecture of the Web, is highly space-efficient,
and lends itself well to content distribution networks. As an example of
using this specification to achieve a number of beneficial privacy and
performance goals, it is possible to create a status list that can be
constructed for 100,000 [=verifiable credentials=] that is roughly
12,500 bytes in size in the worst case. In a case where a few hundred
credentials have been revoked, the size of the list is less than a
few hundred bytes while providing privacy in a group of 100,000 individuals.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>

        <p>
This section outlines the core concept utilized by the status list
mechanism described in this specification. At the most basic level, status
information for all [=verifiable credentials=] issued by an [=issuer=]
is expressed as items in a list. Each [=issuer=] manages a list
of all [=verifiable credentials=] that it has issued. Each
[=verifiable credential=] is associated with an item in its list.
When a single bit specifies a status, such as "revoked" or "suspended",
then that status is expected to be true when the bit is set (`1`) and
false when unset (`0`).
        </p>

        <p>
One of the benefits of using a bitstring is that it is a highly compressible
data format since, in the average case, large numbers of credentials will
remain unrevoked. This will ensure long sections of bits that are the same
value and thus highly compressible using run-length compression techniques
such as GZIP [[RFC1952]]. The default status list size is 131,072 entries,
equivalent to 16&nbsp;KB of single bit values. When only a handful of
[=verifiable credentials=] are revoked, GZIP compresses the bitstring
to a few hundred bytes.
        </p>

        <p>
Another benefit of using a bitstring is that it enables large numbers of
[=verifiable credential=] statuses to be placed in the same list.
This specification uses a minimum list length of 131,072. This
size ensures an adequate amount of group privacy in the average case.
If better group privacy is required, the bitstring can be made larger.
        </p>

          the right reads 16 kilobytes. An depiction of the boxes being GZIP
          compressed into a cylinder on the bottom of the page shows that
          compression has resulted in a final size of 135 bytes.">

        <p class="note"
           title="Status information is about the verifiable credential">
The status information associated with a particular [=verifiable credential=]
is about the [=verifiable credential=] itself and might not apply to any
underlying or backing [=credential=], such as an educational degree. For
example, in the case of such an educational degree, it is possible for a
[=verifiable credential=] to be revoked because the mechanism used to
create its digital signature has been compromised, while the backing educational
degree remains valid.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
There are numerous ways to express status information associated with digital
credentials. Some of these mechanisms include Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)
[[?RFC5280]], the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [[?RFC2560]], Bloom
Filters [[?RFC8932]], and cryptographic accumulators [[?ALLOSAUR]]. This
specification optimizes for a variety of requirements that are different from
other mechanisms. These requirements include:

        <h3>BitstringStatusListEntry</h3>

        <p>
When an [=issuer=] desires to enable status information for a
[=verifiable credential=], they MAY add a `credentialStatus`
property that uses the data model described in this section. Any
expression of the data model in this section MUST be expressed in a
conforming [=verifiable credential=] as defined in [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]].

           title="Bitstring entry sizes greater than 1 are at risk.">
The Working Group is currently seeking implementer feedback regarding the
utility of bitstring entries that have sizes greater than one. Supporting
such entries adds complexity to the solution, and it's not clear whether there
is enough of an implementation community to support the feature. The WG is
considering three options: (1) require conforming implementations to support
the feature; (2) allow implementations to optionally support the feature; or
(3) remove the feature. At present, the specification implements option (2).

Status list entries can be used to express the purpose of a
status associated with a [=verifiable credential=] by using the
`statusPurpose` property.
        </p>
        <p>
The use of `revocation` or `suspension` as the status purpose
includes the semantics of the status, with `revocation`
indicating that a status bit expresses whether a
[=verifiable credential=] has been revoked and `suspension`
indicating that a status bit expresses whether a
[=verifiable credential=] has been suspended. The example below
demonstrates the use of these status purposes:

`statusSize`, `statusMessage`, and optional `statusReference` properties,
at the time of [=verifiable credential=] issuance. This is to ensure that
the [=holder=] knows what sort of information might be associated with a
particular [=verifiable credential=] they keep in their possession, that
could then be discoverable by a [=verifier=] that later receives that

      <section>
        <h3>BitstringStatusListCredential</h3>

        <p>
When a status list [=verifiable credential=] is published, it MUST be a
conforming document, as defined in [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], that expresses the
data model in this section. The following section describes the format of
the [=verifiable credential=] that encapsulates the status list.
        </p>

        <p>
The status list is expressed inside a [=verifiable credential=] in order to
enable a [=holder=] to provide it directly to a [=verifier=]. This mechanism,
sometimes called "certificate stapling", increases privacy for the [=holder=] by
ensuring that the [=verifier=] does not need to contact the [=issuer=] to
retrieve the status list. Still, a [=verifier=] might choose to ignore the
[=holder=]-provided status list, even when its authenticity is verifiable,
if it desires a more recent version of a status list, for instance.
        </p>

        <p>
[=Issuers=] and [=verifiers=] are advised that the [=issuer=] of a
[=verifiable credential=] and the [=issuer=] of an associated
`BitstringStatusListCredential` might not be the same. There are technical,
legal, institutional, political, and other reasons that might make it
appropriate to separate the authority over the original credential from the
authority to revoke, or otherwise change the status of, such a credential.
Therefore, the `issuer` value of a [=verifiable credential=] containing a
`BitstringStatusListEntry` MAY be different from the `issuer` value of a
`BitstringStatusListCredential`.
        </p>

        <p class="issue atrisk" title="TTL conflicts with `validUntil`">
The Working Group is considering the removal of the `ttl` ("time to live")
feature because its semantics conflict with the semantics of the `validUntil`
feature of [=verifiable credentials=]. When a [=verifier=] performs
validation and evaluates a `BitstringStatusListCredential` that contains both
a `ttl` property and a `validUntil` property, each with a different value
(i.e., each indicating a different point in time when the credential is to
"expire"), it is not clear which (if either) property a validator can be
expected to ignore. In other words, if a `ttl` value specifies an expiration
datetime of midnight today, but the `validUntil` property specifies an
expiration datetime of midnight tomorrow, then what is a [=verifier=]
expected to do? Fundamentally, `ttl` and `validUntil` have conflicting
semantics. One way to resolve this conflict is to remove `ttl` and specify
that caching behavior can be expressed using protocol mechanisms (such as the
`expires` header in HTTP), and that any caching performed MUST align with the
`validUntil` value for the [=verifiable credential=]. The Working Group is
seeking feedback from the implementer community regarding this feature.

      <p>
When a `statusListCredential` URL is dereferenced, server implementations MAY
provide a mechanism to dereference the status list as of a particular point in
time. When an [=issuer=] provides such a mechanism, it enables a
[=verifier=] to determine changes in status to a precision chosen by the
issuer, such as hourly, daily, or weekly. If such a feature is supported, and if
query parameters are supported by the URL scheme, then the name of the query
parameter MUST be `timestamp` and the value MUST be a valid URL-encoded
[[XMLSCHEMA11-2]] dateTimeStamp string value. The result of dereferencing such a
timestamp-parameterized URL MUST be either a status list credential containing
the status list as it existed at the given point in time, or a
<a href="#STATUS_RETRIEVAL_ERROR">STATUS_RETRIEVAL_ERROR</a>. If the result is
an error, implementations MAY attempt the retrieval again with a different
timestamp value, or without a timestamp value, as long as the [=verifier=]'s
validation rules permit such an action.
      </p>

      <p>
[=Verifiers=] SHOULD cache the retrieved status list and SHOULD use proxies
or other mechanisms, such as [[[RFC9458]]], that hide retrieval behavior from
the [=issuer=].
      </p>

      <p class="note" title="Issuer validation is use case dependent">
It is expected that a [=verifier=] will ensure that it trusts the issuer
of a [=verifiable credential=], as well as the issuer of the associated
<a href="#bitstringstatuslistcredential">BitstringStatusListCredential</a>,
before using the information contained in either credential for further
decision making purposes. Implementers are advised that the issuers of these
credential might differ, such as when the original issuer of the
[=verifiable credential=] does not maintain a record of its validity.

      <h3>Processing Errors</h3>

      <p>
The algorithms described in this specification throw specific types of errors.
Implementers might find it useful to convey these errors to other libraries or
software systems. This section provides specific URLs, descriptions, and error
codes for the errors, such that an ecosystem implementing technologies described
by this specification might interoperate more effectively when errors occur.
      </p>

      <p>
When exposing these errors through an HTTP interface, implementers SHOULD use
[[[RFC9457]]] [[RFC9457]] to encode the error data structure. If [[RFC9457]] is
used:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The `type` value of the error object MUST be a URL that starts with the value
`https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/status-list#` and ends with the value in the

        <li>
The `code` value MUST be the integer code described in the table below
(in parentheses, beside the type name).
        </li>
        <li>
The `title` value SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for
the error.

        <li>
The `detail` value SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the error.
        </li>
        <li>
All human-readable strings SHOULD be localized as described in Section 1 of
[[[RFC9457]]], using [=language negotiation=] through the `Accept-Language`
HTTP header field to select the most appropriate resources.

There are multiple ways that the information in Section

upon in the

      </p>
      <p>
When securing a [=verifiable credential=] that contains a reference to

implementers SHOULD use the same securing mechanism with the same
cryptographic parameters and the same media type for both
[=verifiable credentials=].

    </section>

  </section>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Media Types</h2>

    <p>
When dereferencing `statusListCredential`, the content of the returned
`statusListCredential` might be any media type registered for the purpose of
expressing a verifiable credential with one or more proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
For example, a verifiable credential secured with Data Integrity Proofs might
have media type `application/vc+ld+json`, while a verifiable credential
secured with SD-JWT might have media type `application/sd-jwt`.
    </p>
    <p>
Some implementations might choose to support less specific media types such as
`application/ld+json` or `application/json`.

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

    <p>
Readers are urged to familiarize themselves with the general
privacy advice provided in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#privacy-considerations">
Privacy Considerations section of the Verifiable Credentials
specification</a> before reading this section.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Revocation Bitstring Length</h3>

      <p>
This document specifies a minimum revocation bitstring length of 131,072, or
16KB uncompressed. This is enough to give [=holders=] an adequate amount of
group privacy if the number of verifiable credentials issued is large enough.
However, if the number of issued verifiable credentials is a small population,
the ability to correlate an individual increases because the number of allocated
slots in the bitstring is small. Correlating this information with, for example,
where the geographic request came from can also help to correlate individuals
that have received a credential from the same geographic region.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Unnecessary Correlation</h3>

      <p>
There are a number of global identifiers used in a status list entry, defined in
Section [[[#bitstringstatuslistentry]]], that can be used across [=verifiers=]
to correlate [=subjects=]. Some of the properties that can
express these values are `id`, `statusListIndex`, and
`statusListCredential`.
      </p>

      <p>
In some cases, such as when [=presentations|presenting=] a [=verifiable
credential=] that contains a global identifier (such as a driver's license
identification number), adding one or more global identifier(s) for status list
information does not increase correlation harm, since a single globally unique
identifier is all that is required for correlation.
      </p>

      <p>
When global identifiers are used in [=presentations=] that use
[=selective disclosure=] or [=unlinkable disclosure=], they can violate privacy
expectations. [=Issuers=] are urged to enable status information to be
selectively disclosable/concealable when a particular [=verifiable credential=]
is expected to be disclosed in a way that does not need correlation, such as when
proving that an individual is above a certain age. [=Verifiers=] can require
that status information be revealed in situations that require them to know the
current status of a credential, and the holder might then consent or refuse to
reveal that information for a given transaction. In all cases, both [=issuers=]
and [=verifiers=] are urged to avoid the use of global identifiers in order to
prevent correlation, unless it is required for or by a particular exchange.
      </p>

      <p>
For information on other types of potential correlation,
readers are urged to study the Privacy Considerations section of the

      <h3>Verifier Caching</h3>

      <p>
It is possible for [=verifiers=] to increase the privacy of the
[=holder=] whose [=verifiable credential=] is being checked by caching
status lists that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the
content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from
[=verifier=]-based access patterns on the status list.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>

      <p>
The use of content distribution networks by [=issuers=] can increase the
privacy of [=holders=] by reducing or eliminating requests for the
status lists from the [=issuer=]. Often, a request for a revocation
list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
on the server as well as cloaking [=verifiers=] and [=holders=]
from [=issuers=].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Decoy Values</h3>

      <p>
[=Issuer=] use of decoy values in status lists has been explored as a mechanism
to increase the privacy of [=subjects=]. While algorithms for employing decoy
values are out of scope for this specification, implementers are advised that...
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="150">
The Working Group is currently discussing what sort of guidance to provide
for decoy values. It has been suggested that decoy values are, in general,
harmful to this specification's privacy characteristics. However, the group
has not provided a complete analysis and thorough review for that assertion.
The analysis might result in some use cases where decoy values are helpful, or
might conclude that decoy values are, in general, harmful. Further
thought is currently being put into the language around decoy values and
it is expected that this language will be finalized during the Candidate
Recommendation phase.
      </p>
        <!-- TEXT BELOW NEEDS TO BE FURTHER ANALYZED AND JUSTIFIED
the use of decoy values does not improve privacy and can harm privacy in
most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
When indexes of status list entries are allocated in a random fashion, which is
the suggested mode of operation for this specification, adding decoys harms
privacy because it reduces the true group size by the number of decoys added
to the group. A random allocation of indexes inherently hides the true size of
the group without reducing it, ensuring that decoys are not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
There might be use cases where decoy values provide benefits. Implementers are
cautioned that no such use cases were clearly identifiable by the group that
created this specification. Therefore, the use of decoys is discouraged for
most if not all use cases, as random allocation of status list entry indexes
provides adequate protection.
      </p>
      -->
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Malicious Issuers and Verifiers</h3>
      <p>
In general, the group privacy protections offered by this specification can be
circumvented by malicious [=issuers=] and [=verifiers=]. Its privacy
benefits can only be realized when issuers and verifiers intend to avoid
tracking or sharing the presentation of particular credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
A malicious [=verifier=] might intentionally attack group privacy by sharing
information from presented credentials with a malicious [=issuer=]. This
sort of collusion is difficult to detect as it is typically performed via a
secure communication channel between the [=issuer=] and the [=verifier=].
      </p>
      <p>
A malicious [=issuer=] might intentionally attack group privacy by creating a
unique status list for each issued credential, in order to establish a one-to-one
mapping to track when a [=verifier=] processes each mapped credential. Similarly,
they could establish a one-to-one mapping by using a different
cryptographic key for each issued credential that is tracked by a given status list.
      </p>
      <p>
This sort of collusion can be detected by [=holder=] software that serves
multiple [=holders=] (e.g., a [=holder=] app that runs on a server) if it
has, for example, an opt-in process that finds that some global identifier(s)
used within a [=verifiable credential=] are not adequately shared by other
credentials.
[=Holders=] could then be warned when presenting a [=verifiable credential=]
that contains some global identifier(s) that are unique to that credential.
Such an opt-in service could represent some additional privacy concerns;
whether this potential exposure via the [=holder=] software is justified by
the awareness of possible global identifier correlation can only be evaluated
by the users of such a system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Monitoring Status Lists</h3>

      <p>
Once a [=verifier=] knows of a status list and entry index that is
associated with a specific [=holder=] or [=subject=], it becomes possible for that
[=verifier=] to see updates to that status entry as long as the
status list continues to be updated. This is useful to a [=verifier=] that
needs to understand when a particular [=verifiable credential=] has changed
status without asking the [=issuer=] directly for status information on
the specific [=verifiable credential=] or when interacting with the [=holder=] to get
the latest status information is not possible. The feature can also cause a
privacy violation for the [=holder=] and/or [=subject=] if the
[=verifier=] is able to perform near-real-time checks on the status of the
[=verifiable credential=].
      </p>

      <p>
[=Issuers=] can provide a level of reprieve from this privacy concern
[=holders=] by revoking and reissuing effectively the same
[=verifiable credential=] on a timeline that is relatively short in nature.
For example, an [=issuer=] could automatically reissue a
[=verifiable credential=] every three months and assign a new status entry
index when the reissuance occurs to break any sort of long-term monitoring
of a [=verifiable credential=] as it changes status.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Correlation of Status Messages</h3>
      <p>
This specification provides a means by which multiple status messages can be
provided for a particular entry in a status list. While this mechanism can
provide more detailed information for a particular entry in the status list,
that information can provide further correlation data.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, if each status message is associated with a step in a particular
process, or more detailed information as to why a credential was revoked or
suspended, then an attacker that observes the changes in the list might be
able to correlate information about the population of entities in the list
that could lead to privacy violations. Understanding how a population
progresses through a business process, or what percentage of the population
is likely to be associated with a certain status, provides additional
information to an attacker. Given such information, a phishing operation could
predict what the next step of a business process is and then preemptively
contact an entity whose current status is known. Then, based on that
information, they could attempt to phish more lucrative information from
the target using data gleaned from the status list over time.
      </p>
      <p>
For these reasons, issuers are urged to evaluate the potential ramifications of
publishing detailed status information about a particular entity, or a
population, in a public manner.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Alteration of Status Messages</h3>

      <p>
When a status list uses the status messages feature, it becomes possible for
the [=issuer=] to increase the types of messages that are associated with
the [=verifiable credentials=] it issues over time.
      </p>

      <p>
This feature creates a potential privacy violation where the
[=subject=] or [=holder=] of the [=verifiable credential=] might be
associated with additional status information that was not present when the
original [=verifiable credential=] was issued. For example, initial status
messages might convey "delayed" and "canceled", but additional status messages
might be added by the [=issuer=] to convey "delayed due to non-payment" and
"canceled due to illegal activity". This change would not be apparent to the
[=subject=] or [=holder=] unless there was monitoring software operating
on their behalf that would warn them that the [=issuer=] intends to expose
additional information about their activity.
      </p>

      <p>
Holder software can provide features to [=holders=] that warn them about the
level of [=holder=] and/or [=subject=] information exposure when using
[=verifiable credentials=] that are associated with status messages, and warn
them when the level of information exposure changes.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be

      <h3>Bitstring Encoding</h3>

      <p>
It is critical that implementers pay particular attention to the way that they
encode and decode bitstrings. Failure to do so can result in checking the
wrong bitstring index for a given credential, leading to a misinterpretation
of its present state (e.g., mistaking a revoked status for an unrevoked
status). As stated in Section <a href="#bitstringstatuslistcredential"></a>,
bitstrings are encoded such that the first (zeroth) index refers to the
left-most bit of the bitstring array. The diagram below demonstrates the
proper layout for an uncompressed bitstring.

             labeled 'Last byte'. The left rectangle's left-most bit box is
             pointed to by an arrow labeled 'index: 0'. The right rectangle's
             right-most bit box is pointed to by an arrow labeled

        <h2>Multiple Status Entries in a Single List</h2>

        <p>
It is possible for a single status list to contain multiple types of status
purposes. Doing so can make the retrieval of a list slightly more efficient
than fetching multiple status lists.
        </p>

        <p class="issue atrisk" title="Efficiency argument is weak">
The "space efficiency" argument for this feature is weak. One list with two types
of status entries must, presumably, be twice as long as a list with one type of
status entries, to ensure proper privacy protections. One privacy benefit of
doing so is that bit flips cannot be known to be associated with a particular
status unless one is also in control of the VC that the status is about.
Therefore, mixing "revocation" and "suspension" in a single list that is twice
as large has positive privacy implications.<br><br>
The "retrieval efficiency" argument is also weak. Performing two HTTP retrievals
instead of one is probably not significant. Performing upwards of five or six,
on a list that is five or six times larger, might result in fairly meager
savings over modern versions of HTTP that bundle requests over a single channel
(such as HTTP/2 or HTTP/3). The requests themselves would save a handful of
bytes with no significant improvement in retrieval speed.<br><br>
The Working Group is looking for feedback from implementers and is considering
striking this feature during the Candidate Recommendation period, since it would
simplify the specification for implementations to not have to support sets of
`statusPurpose` values in the status list credentials (again, a meager savings
in space efficiency at a small cost to retrieval efficiency).
