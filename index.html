      <p>
This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and
high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as
suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials through use of bitstrings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'></section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
It is often useful for an <a>issuer</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a>
[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] to link to a location where a <a>verifier</a> can check to see
if a credential has been suspended or revoked. There are a variety of privacy
and performance considerations that are made when designing, publishing, and
processing status lists.
      </p>
      <p>
One such privacy consideration happens when there is a one-to-one mapping
between a <a>verifiable credential</a> and a URL where the status is
published. This type of mapping enables the website that publishes the URL to
correlate the <a>holder</a>, time, and <a>verifier</a> when the status is
checked. This could enable the <a>issuer</a> to discover the type of interaction
the <a>holder</a> is having with the <a>verifier</a>, such as providing an age
verification credential when entering a bar. Being tracked by the <a>issuer</a>
of a driver's license when entering an establishment violates a privacy
expectation that many people have today.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, there are performance considerations that are explored when designing
status lists. One such consideration is where the list is published and the
burden it places from a bandwidth and processing perspective, both on the server
and the client fetching the information. In order to meet privacy expectations,
it is useful to bundle the status of large sets of credentials into a single
list to help with group privacy. However, doing so can place an impossible
burden on both the server and client if the status information is as much as a
few hundred bytes in size per credential across a population of
hundreds of millions of <a>holders</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The rest of this document proposes a highly compressible, bitstring-based
status list mechanism with strong privacy-preserving characteristics,
that is compatible with the architecture of the Web, is highly space-efficient,
and lends itself well to content distribution networks. As an example of
using this specification to achieve a number of beneficial privacy and
performance goals, it is possible to create a status list that can be
constructed for 100,000 <a>verifiable credentials</a> that is roughly
12,500 bytes in size in the worst case. In a case where a few hundred
credentials have been revoked, the size of the list is less than a
few hundred bytes while providing privacy in a group of 100,000 individuals.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>

        <p>
This section outlines the core concept utilized by the status list
mechanism described in this specification. At the most basic level, status
information for all <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a>
is expressed as items in a list. Each <a>issuer</a> manages a list
of all <a>verifiable credentials</a> that it has issued. Each
<a>verifiable credential</a> is associated with an item in its list.
When a single bit specifies a status, such as "revoked" or "suspended",
then that status is expected to be true when the bit is set (`1`) and
false when unset (`0`).
        </p>

        <p>
One of the benefits of using a bitstring is that it is a highly compressible
data format since, in the average case, large numbers of credentials will
remain unrevoked. This will ensure long sections of bits that are the same
value and thus highly compressible using run-length compression techniques
such as GZIP [[RFC1952]]. The default status list size is 131,072 entries,
equivalent to 16&nbsp;KB of single bit values. When only a handful of
<a>verifiable credentials</a> are revoked, GZIP compresses the bitstring
to a few hundred bytes.
        </p>

        <p>
Another benefit of using a bitstring is that it enables large numbers of
<a>verifiable credential</a> statuses to be placed in the same list.
This specification uses a minimum list length of 131,072. This
size ensures an adequate amount of group privacy in the average case.
If better group privacy is required, the bitstring can be made larger.

               GZIP compressed into a cylinder on the bottom of the page shows
               that compression has resulted in a final size of 135 bytes.">

           title="Status information is about the verifiable credential">
The status information associated with a particular <a>verifiable credential</a>
is about the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself and might not apply to any
underlying or backing <a>credential</a>, such as an educational degree. For
example, in the case of such an educational degree, it is possible for a
<a>verifiable credential</a> to be revoked because the mechanism used to
create its digital signature has been compromised, while the backing educational
degree remains valid.

        <h3>BitstringStatusListCredential</h3>

        <p>
When a status list <a>verifiable credential</a> is published, it MUST be a
conforming document, as defined in [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], that expresses the
data model in this section. The following section describes the format of
the <a>verifiable credential</a> that encapsulates the status list:
        </p>

        <p class="issue atrisk"
           title="Bitstring entry sizes greater than 1 are at risk.">
The Working Group is currently seeking implementer feedback regarding the
utility of bitstring entries that have sizes greater than one. Supporting
such entries adds complexity to the solution, and it's not clear whether there
is enough of an implementation community to support the feature. The WG is
considering three options: (1) require conforming implementations to support
the feature; (2) allow implementations to optionally support the feature; or
(3) remove the feature. At present, the specification implements option (2).
        </p>


        <p class="issue atrisk" title="TTL conflicts with `validUntil`">
The Working Group is considering the removal of the `ttl` ("time to live")
feature because its semantics conflict with the semantics of the `validUntil`
feature of <a>verifiable credentials</a>. When a <a>verifier</a> performs
validation and evaluates a `BitstringStatusListCredential` that contains both
a `ttl` property and a `validUntil` property, each with a different value
(i.e., each indicating a different point in time when the credential is to
"expire"), it is not clear which (if either) property a validator can be
expected to ignore. In other words, if a `ttl` value specifies an expiration
datetime of midnight today, but the `validUntil` property specifies an
expiration datetime of midnight tomorrow, then what is a <a>verifier</a>
expected to do? Fundamentally, `ttl` and `validUntil` have conflicting
semantics. One way to resolve this conflict is to remove `ttl` and specify
that caching behavior can be expressed using protocol mechanisms (such as the
`expires` header in HTTP), and that any caching performed MUST align with the
`validUntil` value for the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The Working Group is
seeking feedback from the implementer community regarding this feature.

<a>Issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a> are advised that the `issuer` of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> and the `issuer` of an associated
`BitstringStatusListCredential` might not be the same. There are technical,
legal, institutional, and political reasons that might make it appropriate
to separate the authority over the original credential from the authority to
revoke such a credential. Therefore, the `issuer` value of a <a>verifiable

the `issuer` value of a `BitstringStatusListCredential`.

query parameters are supported by the URL scheme, then the name of the query
parameter MUST be `timestamp` and the value MUST be a valid URL-encoded
[[XMLSCHEMA11-2]] dateTimeStamp string value. The result of dereferencing such a
timestamp-parameterized URL MUST be either a status list credential containing
the status list as it existed at the given point in time, or a
<a href="#STATUS_RETRIEVAL_ERROR">STATUS_RETRIEVAL_ERROR</a>. If the result is
an error, implementations MAY attempt the retrieval again with a different

codes for the errors, such that an ecosystem implementing technologies described
by this specification might interoperate more effectively when errors occur.

The `code` value MUST be the integer code described in the table below

        <li>
The `title` value SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for

        <li>
The `detail` value SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the error.

When securing a <a>verifiable credential</a> that contains a reference to

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Media Types</h2>

    <p>
<a>Issuers</a> SHOULD publish status list information
using HTTPS URLs and in ways that minimize possible correlation of usage
patterns related to the list. <a>Verifiers</a>
SHOULD retrieve status list information using protocols that guard against access
pattern correlation, such as Oblivious HTTP [[?OHTTP]].
    </p>

    <p>
When dereferencing `statusListCredential`, the content of the returned
`statusListCredential` might be any media type registered for the purpose of
expressing a verifiable credential with one or more proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
For example, a verifiable credential secured with Data Integrity Proofs might
have media type `application/vc+ld+json`, while a verifiable credential
secured with SD-JWT might have media type `application/sd-jwt`.

Some implementations might choose to support less specific media types such as

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

    <p>
Readers are urged to familiarize themselves with the general
privacy advice provided in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#privacy-considerations">
Privacy Considerations section of the Verifiable Credentials
specification</a> before reading this section.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Revocation Bitstring Length</h3>

      <p>
This document specifies a minimum revocation bitstring length of 131,072, or
16KB uncompressed. This is enough to give <a>holders</a> an adequate amount of
group privacy if the number of verifiable credentials issued is large enough.
However, if the number of issued verifiable credentials is a small population,
the ability to correlate an individual increases because the number of allocated
slots in the bitstring is small. Correlating this information with, for example,
where the geographic request came from can also help to correlate individuals
that have received a credential from the same geographic region.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Verifier Caching</h3>

      <p>
It is possible for <a>verifiers</a> to increase the privacy of the
<a>holder</a> whose <a>verifiable credential</a> is being checked by caching
status lists that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the
content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from
<a>verifier</a>-based access patterns on the status list.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>

      <p>
The use of content distribution networks by <a>issuers</a> can increase the
privacy of <a>holders</a> by reducing or eliminating requests for the
status lists from the <a>issuer</a>. Often, a request for a revocation
list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
on the server as well as cloaking <a>verifiers</a> and <a>holders</a>
from <a>issuers</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Malicious Issuers and Verifiers</h3>
      <p>
In general, the group privacy protections offered by this specification can be
circumvented by malicious <a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>. Its privacy
benefits can only be realized when issuers and verifiers intend to avoid
tracking or sharing the presentation of particular credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
A malicious <a>issuer</a> might intentionally attack group privacy by creating a
unique status list per credential issued in order to establish a one-to-one mapping to track
when a <a>verifier</a> processes a specific credential. Similarly, they could establish
another a one-to-one mapping by using a different cryptographic key for every credential
issued that is tracked in a status list.
      </p>
      <p>
A malicious <a>verifier</a> might intentionally attack group privacy by sharing
information from presented credentials with a malicious <a>issuer</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Multistatus Correlation</h3>
      <p>
This specification provides a means by which multiple status messages can be
provided for a particular entry in a status list. While this mechanism can
provide more detailed information for a particular entry in the status list,
that information can provide further correlation data.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, if each status message is associated with a step in a particular
process, or more detailed information as to why a credential was revoked or
suspended, then an attacker that observes the changes in the list might be
able to correlate information about the population of entities in the list
that could lead to privacy violations. Understanding how a population
progresses through a business process, or what percentage of the population
is likely to be associated with a certain status, provides additional
information to an attacker. Given such information, a phishing operation could
predict what the next step of a business process is and then preemptively
contact an entity whose current status is known. Then, based on that
information, they could attempt to phish more lucrative information from
the target using data gleaned from the status list over time.
      </p>
      <p>
For these reasons, issuers are urged to evaluate the potential ramifications of
publishing detailed status information about a particular entity, or a
population, in a public manner.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
Readers are urged to familiarize themselves with the general
security advice provided in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#security-considerations">
Security Considerations section of the Verifiable Credentials
specification</a> before reading this section.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Bitstring Encoding</h3>

      <p>
It is critical that implementers pay particular attention to the way that they
encode and decode bitstrings. Failure to do so can result in checking the
wrong bitstring index for a given credential, leading to a misinterpretation
of its present state (e.g., mistaking a revoked status for an unrevoked
status). As stated in Section <a href="#bitstringstatuslistcredential"></a>,
bitstrings are encoded such that the first (zeroth) index refers to the
left-most bit of the bitstring array. The diagram below demonstrates the
proper layout for an uncompressed bitstring.
      </p>

      <figure id="bitstring-layout">
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
             src="diagrams/bitstring-layout.svg" alt="a diagram showing two
             wide rectangles shown side-by-side. Each rectangle is partitioned
             into eight boxes to represent the 8 bits in a byte. The left
             rectangle is labeled 'First byte' and the right rectangle is
             labeled 'Last byte'. The left rectangle's left-most bit box is
             pointed to by an arrow labeled 'index: 0'. The right rectangle's
             right-most bit box is pointed to by an arrow labeled
             'index: length - 1'.">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
          A visual depiction of the bitstring layout.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
For example, if a bitstring is 131,072 bits in size (16KB), the first index will
be 0, and the last index will be 131,071.

        <h2>Multiple Status Entries in a Single List</h2>

        <p>
It is possible for a single status list to contain multiple types of status
purposes. Doing so can make the retrieval of a list slightly more efficient
than fetching multiple status lists.
        </p>

        <p class="issue atrisk" title="Efficiency argument is weak">
The "space efficiency" argument for this feature is weak. One list with two types
of status entries must, presumably, be twice as long as a list with one type of
status entries, to ensure proper privacy protections. One privacy benefit of
doing so is that bit flips cannot be known to be associated with a particular
status unless one is also in control of the VC that the status is about.
Therefore, mixing "revocation" and "suspension" in a single list that is twice
as large has positive privacy implications.<br><br>
The "retrieval efficiency" argument is also weak. Performing two HTTP retrievals
instead of one is probably not significant. Performing upwards of five or six,
on a list that is five or six times larger, might result in fairly meager
savings over modern versions of HTTP that bundle requests over a single channel
(such as HTTP/2 or HTTP/3). The requests themselves would save a handful of
bytes with no significant improvement in retrieval speed.<br><br>
The Working Group is looking for feedback from implementers and is considering
striking this feature during the Candidate Recommendation period, since it would
simplify the specification for implementations to not have to support sets of
`statusPurpose` values in the status list credentials (again, a meager savings
in space efficiency at a small cost to retrieval efficiency).
