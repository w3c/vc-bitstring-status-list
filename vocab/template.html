      <h2>Specification of terms</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the terms &mdash; i.e., the properties and classes &mdash; used in
        the VCDM are formally specified in Recommendation Track documents published by
        the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working
        Group</a>. In each case of such external definition, the term's description in
        this document contains a link to the relevant specification. Additionally, the
        `rdfs:definedBy` property in the RDFS representation(s) refers to the formal
        specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a local explanation is necessary to complement, or to replace,
        the definition found in an external specification. For instance, this is so when
        the term is needed to provide a consistent structure to the RDFS vocabulary,
        such as when the term defines a common supertype for class instances that are
        used as objects of specific properties. For such cases,
        the extra definition is included in the current
        document (and the `rdfs:comment` property is used to include them in the RDFS
        representations).

      <h2>Diagram description</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Overview diagram of the vocabulary (without the `xsd` datatypes). The terms prefixed by <code>cred:</code> or
        <code>sec:</code> are not defined in this vocabulary; they have only been added to the diagram for the sake of clarity.</summary>
        <p>
          The diagram uses boxes, ellipses, and connecting lines with different "styles"
          (border color, end marker, line type) to differentiate their semantic meaning:
          "Property", "Class", and "Datatype" are identified by the shape of the
          graph node (e.g., an ellipse signifies a "Class"); "Superclass", "Domain Of", or "Range" relationships 
          are identified by the style of the connecting line.
          These style names are used in the explanation text that follows, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagram is roughly divided into three sections — left, middle, and right.
          To make this description easier to understand, these sections will be respectively referred to
          as the "Classes", "Properties", and "Values" sections.
          Shapes in the three sections are connected by lines of different styles.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Classes Section</h3>

          <p>
            The section contains three ellipses, labeled as "cred:CredentialStatus",
            "BitstringStatusListEntry", and "BitstringStatusList". It also contains
            a box, styled as "Property" and labeled as "cred:credentialStatus".
          </p>

          <p>
            The "cred:CredentialStatus" ellipse, is connected to the ellipse, 
            labeled as "cred:CredentialStatus", with a line styled "Range". 
            The ellipse labeled as "BitstringStatusListEntry" is connected to the 
            ellipse, labeled as "cred:CredentialStatus", with a line styled as 
            "Superclass".
          </p>

          <p>
            The ellipses labeled as "BitstringStatusListEntry" and "BitstringStatusList" are 
            also connected to a number of boxes, all styled as "Property", with lines styled as
            "Domain Of"; see the "Properties" section below for further details.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Properties Section</h3>

          <p>
            The section contains a number of boxes, each styles as "Property". The labels of 
            these boxes are "statusListIndex", "statusListCredential", "statusPurpose", 
            "statusMessage", "ttl", "statusReference", "statusSize", and "encodedList".
            There is also a small, unlabeled circle, which serves as an intersection point for connector
            lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ellipse labeled as "BitstringStatusListEntry", described in the previous section, is 
            connected to the "statusListIndex", and "statusListCredential" boxes with lines styled as "Domain Of". 
            The ellipse labeled as "BitstringStatusList", also described in the previous section, 
            is connected to the "statusMessage", "ttl", "statusReference", "statusSize", 
            and "encodedList" boxes, also with lines styled as "Domain Of".
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the ellipses labeled as "BitstringStatusListEntry" and "BitstringStatusList" are connected to the 
            intersection point with a line styled as "Domain Of", and the intersection point is connected to the 
            box labeled as "statusPurpose with a line styled as "Domain Of".
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Values Section</h3>

          <p>
            The section contains and ellipse, labeled as "BitstringStatusListCredential", which is connected to 
            another ellipse, labeled as "cred:VerifiableCredential", with a line styled as "Superclass". 
            The box labeled as "statusListCredential", described in the previous section, is connected to the ellipse, 
            labeled as "BitstringStatusListCredential", with a line styled as "Range".
          </p>

          <p>
            Another ellipse, labeled as "BistringStatusMessage", is connected to two boxes with lines styled 
            as "Domain Of". The boxes are styled as "Property" and are labeled with "status" and "message". 
            The box labeled as "statusMessage", described in the previous section, is connected to the ellipse,
            labeled as "BistringStatusMessage", with a line styled as "Range".
          </p>

          <p>
            The box labeled as "statusSize", described in the previous section, is connected to a box, styled 
            as "Datatype", and labeled as "xsd:positiveInteger", with a line styled as "Range".
          </p>

          <p>
            The box labeled as "encodedList", described in the previous section, is connected to a box, styled
            as "Datatype", and labeled as "sec:multibase", with a line styled as "Range".
